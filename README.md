# Local development

To start the application:

```
npm run start
```

The application uses a proxy to redirect the traffic to `localhost:8080`. If the port changes, you have to update
the target port (`target: 'http://localhost:<NEW_PORT>'`)

# Production development

Gui can be found here: http://34.133.193.155:80

Or else:

```
kubectl get svc frontend-service
```

And in the browser, go to `<EXTERNAL-IP>:80`
